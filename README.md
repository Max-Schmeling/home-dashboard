# vanilla-home-dashboard

Just some dashboard action displaying a regional traffic map (using Google Maps Javascript API) and regional weather data (using the APIs of OpenWeatherMap and AccuWeather). No frameworks used - just barebons html css and js. I had the dashboard(s) running on a pi, launched using the python script. Currently not working on them anymore. There is lots of potential for customization and improvement.
